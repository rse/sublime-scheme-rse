Sublime Text Color Scheme RSE
=============================

This is Ralf S. Engelschall (RSE)'s discreet color scheme for the
Sublime Text editor (http://www.sublimetext.com/). It uses just 4
colors: "white" for the background, "back" as the default text color,
"blue" for all language constructs (keywords and punctation characters)
and "brown" for all literals (strings, numbers, etc). Nothing more,
nothing less! Use this in combination with the great "Soda Light" theme.
For this, use Package Control to install "Theme - Soda" and "Color
Scheme - RSE" and use the following additional Sublime Text 2 user
preferences and you get a very elegant coding environment:

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme",
        "soda_classic_tabs": true,
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme RSE/RSE.tmTheme",
        "font_face": "DejaVu Sans Mono",
        "line_padding_bottom": -2,
        "line_padding_top": 0
    }
